              <h2>April 9th, 2020 - Strive to Try</h2>
              <p>To everyone on the Internet, hello! I am in the works of becoming a web-developer of some sort. To start, I began my journey in Skillcrush's "Break Into Tech" program. I enjoyed all the lessons and videos on how they broke each concept down. Coding is definitely like learning a new language and a sport. With each lesson, you have to try and attempt to use what you've learned in multiple areas. <br>
              <p>Everyone can be a great student, but what divides are those who can transform those concepts into wonderful products. The big mountain I am getting over each day I code, is fear and failure. I strive for perfection with the hopes I get things right the first time. Coding doesn't truly follow that concept. Trial and error is my new best friend and my new normal. I am re-wiring my brain to simply enjoy the process. <br>
              Each day comes with less fear as I tackle on little portions of web development that will make the bigger picture beautiful. <br>
              <p>Until then, I will document my journey here. I will enjoy the process and not look too far ahead. <br>
              </p>

            <h2>April 17th, 2020 - Site is Live</h2>
            <p>I am officially live and with you all, Internet Land! I felt I needed to simply push myself to get this site live. I understand it's not perfect, nor ready, but I wanted to get this out to the world. </p>
            <p> This site is going to be my baby. The simple details are there and projects will grow as I continue into my Skillcrush journey.</p>
